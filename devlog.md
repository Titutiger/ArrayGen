# DevLog:

### General Notes:
When I was in school, it was hard to visulise graphs for many Science functions. When we did plottings,
we would only do them for 2-3 points which didn't really give a clear idea. This project was made in
memory of those times wherein I was told that it is a parabola but it looked like a line!
Here, you can actually see what is happening.

I made a devlog before this but I am not sure where that exactly went, so for on, let this be the date
of the official devlog.
Of course, this project started on 17th August 2025, but I was too dumb to write anything back then.

My exams are currently going on and so, for the project, this month as well as the next one will see
little to no development. What may happen is that I will update this log whenever I want to add something 
new or have an idea on what to add. And ofcourse, some of my math trauma.

____

- Want to create specific file output locations for `.Chem.Electron_Shell()`
- Want to add ways to import/export data.

- Want to add slope formulae and line forms in .Maths from the chapter Straight Lines

____

I am in a doubt on whether to make this a software, or a library. Because, some of the things that I want to 
add work like softwares. But at the same time, I want this to be a library. I'll think about this later on.

#### $$ 4th October 2025: $$
I did add the specific output file for `.Chem.Electron_Shell()` as the `/vid` file where the `.html` files 
will be kept.

- I am thinking of adding AI capabilities for small functions such as:
if I have a dataset of domains and co-domains, and I want to find the equation which can produces the co-domains 
from the domains, I want to make an AI model which can do that.

- I am also thinking of adding a way to view vectors on graphs, maybe interactively...
Maybe I shall also add another param such that the domains and co-domains of `.expr()` will be saved in a polar pd 
and maybe exported as a `.csv` or `.xlsx`.

In school, we also learnt about this chapter called as 'straight lines', it seams interesting enough and I think the 
AI could be used here too as it has many formulae.

Finally launched ArrayGen v1.4 at 4pm IST.
And now, at 9:38, I'm making changes to the cross and vector magnitude functions, as to make them more efficient.
I might also make `.expr()` more interactive via `inb_`.
